# MCP Correlation IDs

Issue [#572](https://github.com/mind-vault-1/mindvault/issues/572), extended by
[#1074](https://github.com/mind-vault-1/mindvault/issues/1074).

The audit log records a tool call as several independent entries: a `start`,
every network request the tool made, and a `success` or `error`. Nothing tied
them together. With one agent making one call at a time you can read the order
and guess; with two concurrent calls, or a log covering a whole session,
"which of these four Horizon requests belonged to the purchase that failed?"
was unanswerable.

Every tool call now runs under a correlation ID.

## Shape

```
mv-1a2b3c4d-e5f6-k7q2p1
│  │        │    └── salt, base36, fixed width — distinguishes worker processes
│  │        └── random, base36, fixed width
│  └── timestamp, base36 — sorts chronologically as a string
└── prefix, so it is recognisable in a mixed log
```

Short on purpose: it is meant to be read aloud, pasted into an issue, and typed
into a `grep`.

## Where it appears

**On every audit entry** produced during the call, including the network
requests made underneath it:

```
$ jq -c 'select(.correlationId == "mv-1a2b3c4d-e5f6-k7q2p1")' audit.jsonl
{"timestamp":"…","toolName":"mindvault_buy","status":"start","correlationId":"mv-1a2b3c4d-e5f6-k7q2p1"}
{"timestamp":"…","method":"GET","endpoint":"…","source":"api","correlationId":"mv-1a2b3c4d-e5f6-k7q2p1"}
{"timestamp":"…","toolName":"mindvault_buy","status":"error","correlationId":"mv-1a2b3c4d-e5f6-k7q2p1"}
```

**In the tool result's `_meta`**, under `mindvault/correlationId` — the key MCP
reserves for out-of-band annotation:

```json
{
  "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "…" }],
  "_meta": { "mindvault/correlationId": "mv-1a2b3c4d-e5f6-k7q2p1" }
}
```

It is deliberately **not** appended to the text the agent reads. That would
change every tool's output and put an opaque token in front of the model on
every successful call, for no benefit.

**In the error text**, on failures only:

```
Error: Payment failed: insufficient balance [correlation: mv-1a2b3c4d-e5f6-k7q2p1]
```

A failure is the one case where a human is likely to quote the ID back, so it
needs to be somewhere they can see it.

## Concurrency

The ID lives in an `AsyncLocalStorage`, not a module-level variable.

The server handles tool calls concurrently. A shared mutable "current ID" would
attribute one call's network requests to another — producing a log that _looks_
correct, which is worse than having no IDs at all. Each call gets its own
context, and it survives `await` boundaries and nested helpers.

Outside a tool call there is no ID and the field is omitted, rather than filled
with a placeholder. An entry with no ID is honest about not belonging to a
call.

### Across processes

Several MCP server processes may share a host, or start at the same instant.
So that their IDs cannot collide even when their clocks and randomness line up,
each process seeds a per-process **salt** — six base36 digits drawn from the
CSPRNG and mixed with the pid and worker-thread id.

A collision across processes therefore requires both the four-digit random
component _and_ the six-digit salt to match: about one in 6×10¹⁵ for a pair
minting in the same millisecond. The salt is fixed for the life of the process,
so every ID one process mints is trivially recognisable as its own when a log
from several processes is merged.

Code that runs several generators in one process — tests, or an embedded
multi-tenant server — can ask for an independent stream explicitly:

```ts
import { createCorrelationIdGenerator } from "./correlation.js";

const nextId = createCorrelationIdGenerator(); // own salt, own namespace
```

## Using it from a tool

Nothing to do — the server factory mints the ID and audit logging picks it up
from the ambient context. Code that needs it explicitly can ask:

```ts
import { currentCorrelationId } from "./correlation.js";

const id = currentCorrelationId(); // undefined outside a tool call
```

To correlate work that is not a tool call (a background refresh, a startup
check), wrap it:

```ts
import { withNewCorrelationId } from "./correlation.js";

await withNewCorrelationId(async (id) => {
  // every audit entry in here carries `id`
});
```

## Exporting a request trace (#1068)

Operators and tooling can export the full bounded trace for a single correlation
ID across tool lifecycle, API (`source: "api"`), payment (`x402-payment`,
`source: "x402" | "horizon"`), and registry (`onchain-*`,
`source: "soroban" | "registry" | "sponsored"`) operations using
`exportCorrelationTrace` (or `buildCorrelationTrace` for in-memory audit
entries) from [`mcp/src/traceExport.ts`](../mcp/src/traceExport.ts):

```ts
import { exportCorrelationTrace } from "./traceExport.js";

const trace = exportCorrelationTrace("/var/log/mindvault/audit.jsonl", correlationId, {
  maxSpans: 200,
  expectedDomains: ["tool", "api", "payment", "registry"],
});
```

- **Bounded**: Reads at most `MAX_TRACE_EXPORT_BYTES` (1 MiB) from the tail of
  the JSONL log and returns at most `MAX_TRACE_EXPORT_SPANS` (500) spans.
- **Ordered**: Preserves chronological and file sequence ordering across
  lifecycle and network spans (`trace.spans[i].index === i`).
- **Redacted**: Every exported span passes through `redactObject`,
  `redactSecrets`, and a Stellar secret-key sweep so API keys, bearer tokens,
  proxy credentials, and `S…` secret keys are never exposed.
- **Explicit missing-span reporting**: `trace.missingSpans` reports missing
  `tool:start`, `tool:terminal`, `payment:start`, `payment:terminal`, or any
  `expectedDomains` (`<domain>:operation`) that were not observed, and marks
  `trace.complete = false` (`trace.status = "incomplete" | "not_found"`).

## Coverage

- [`mcp/src/correlation.test.ts`](../mcp/src/correlation.test.ts) — ID format
  and determinism, context propagation across `await`, isolation between
  concurrent calls, cross-generator and cross-process collision resistance, and
  audit-log stamping
- [`mcp/src/serverFactory.test.ts`](../mcp/src/serverFactory.test.ts) — the ID
  attached to a real MCP result over an in-memory session
