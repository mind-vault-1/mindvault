# MCP Server Factory

Issue [#575](https://github.com/mind-vault-1/mindvault/issues/575).

`index.ts` built its `Server`, registered four request handlers, constructed a
`StdioServerTransport` and connected — all at module scope, guarded by
`if (!process.env.VITEST)`. That guard was the tell: the only way to import the
server without also starting a stdio transport was to pretend to be the test
runner.

`serverFactory.ts` separates the three things that were fused: **building** a
configured server, **connecting** it to a transport, and **shutting it down**.

## Why it matters

| Before                                              | After                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Only stdio could host the server                    | Any transport the SDK accepts                                   |
| Tests mocked the SDK and never exercised the wiring | Tests drive a real `Server` and `Client` over an in-memory pair |
| Shutdown called `process.exit` unconditionally      | The host decides; `exitOnShutdown` opts into the old behaviour  |
| One instance per process                            | Independent instances can run side by side                      |

## Building

```ts
import { createMindVaultServer } from "./serverFactory.js";

const server = createMindVaultServer({
  listTools: () => advertisedTools,
  dispatchTool: (name, args, onProgress) => dispatchTool(name, args, onProgress),
  listPrompts: () => promptSummaries,
  getPrompt,
  structuredResult,
  formatError: safeErrorMessage,
  errorContent: troubleshootingFor,
  createProgressEmitter: (token, send) => createProgressEmitter({ token, send }),
});
```

Construction has **no side effects**. The returned server is inert until
something calls `connect`, which is what makes it usable from a test or an
embedding host without a guard to work around.

Behaviour is injected rather than imported from `index.ts`. Importing the
entrypoint would execute it — the problem this exists to solve.

`listPrompts` and `getPrompt` go together; supplying one without the other
throws at construction rather than failing on the first request. Prompt
capability is advertised only when prompts are supplied.

## Starting

```ts
import { startServer } from "./serverFactory.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const running = await startServer(server, new StdioServerTransport(), {
  onShutdown: () => saveState(),
  handleSignals: true,
  exitOnShutdown: true,
});
```

| Option           | Default | Effect                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onShutdown`     | none    | Runs before close — persist state, flush a log                                   |
| `onExit`         | none    | Runs after close                                                                 |
| `handleSignals`  | `false` | Wire SIGINT/SIGTERM. Off by default — a library must not grab them from its host |
| `exitOnShutdown` | `false` | `process.exit` with the conventional codes (130 on SIGINT)                       |

Transport close, transport error, signals and an explicit `running.shutdown()`
all funnel into one shutdown that runs **at most once**. A transport error
during shutdown would otherwise re-enter and double-run the hooks. A throwing
`onShutdown` hook does not prevent the close.

## Testing against it

The reason this shape is worth having:

```ts
import { InMemoryTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/inMemory.js";
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";

const [clientTransport, serverTransport] = InMemoryTransport.createLinkedPair();
const client = new Client({ name: "test", version: "1.0.0" }, { capabilities: {} });

await Promise.all([server.connect(serverTransport), client.connect(clientTransport)]);

const result = await client.callTool({ name: "mindvault_browse", arguments: {} });
```

A real session, no mocked SDK.

## Adding a transport

Nothing in `serverFactory.ts` imports a transport — a test asserts that, since
re-introducing a stdio import would make it transport-agnostic in name only. A
new transport costs a call site:

```ts
const running = await startServer(server, new SSEServerTransport("/messages", res));
```

## Correlation IDs

Every tool call the factory dispatches runs under a fresh correlation ID
(see [mcp-correlation-ids.md](mcp-correlation-ids.md)), stamped on the audit
entries the call produces and attached to the result's `_meta`.

## Coverage

- [`mcp/src/serverFactory.test.ts`](../mcp/src/serverFactory.test.ts) — tools,
  prompts, errors and correlation IDs over a real in-memory MCP session, plus
  the shutdown lifecycle and the transport-independence guard
