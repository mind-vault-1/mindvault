/**
 * Paid-operation confirmation policy (#594).
 *
 * Some MCP tools spend the agent's money. `mindvault_buy` transfers the
 * resource's asking price in USDC; `mindvault_publish` pays the ~$0.10 USDC
 * x402 verification fee. Others spend only network fees, but they still debit
 * the wallet and land an irreversible transaction on-chain.
 *
 * Two guardrails already exist and neither covers this:
 *
 *   - The **mainnet guardrail** (`mainnetGuardrails.ts`) is network-scoped. On
 *     testnet it never fires, so an agent loop that spends in a cycle is only
 *     caught once it is spending real money.
 *   - The **auto-pay ceiling** (`paymentCeiling.ts`) is amount-scoped. It stops
 *     one large purchase; it says nothing about a hundred small ones.
 *
 * This policy is the third axis: *did the caller mean to spend at all?* It is
 * network-independent and amount-independent, so an operator can require an
 * explicit `confirmPaid: true` on every spend regardless of where the agent is
 * pointed or how cheap the resource is.
 *
 *   MINDVAULT_CONFIRM_PAID_OPERATIONS=off   (default — unchanged behaviour)
 *   MINDVAULT_CONFIRM_PAID_OPERATIONS=usdc  (tools that spend USDC)
 *   MINDVAULT_CONFIRM_PAID_OPERATIONS=all   (also tools that spend network fees)
 *
 * The default is `off` on purpose. This is an opt-in belt for operators who
 * want one, not a new obstacle in front of every existing agent — a guardrail
 * that breaks working deployments on upgrade gets switched off wholesale,
 * which is worse than not shipping it.
 *
 * The policy composes with the other two rather than replacing them: a mainnet
 * buy above the ceiling with `MINDVAULT_CONFIRM_PAID_OPERATIONS=usdc` must
 * satisfy all three. Each answers a different question, so each keeps its own
 * error message.
 *
 * This module is pure — it classifies, decides, and formats. `index.ts` calls
 * `assertPaidOperationConfirmed` in the dispatcher.
