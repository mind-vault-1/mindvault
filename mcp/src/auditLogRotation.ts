/**
 * Size-based rotation for the JSONL audit log — issue #592.
 *
 * Audit entries currently go to stderr only, pretty-printed across several
 * lines. That is fine to watch live and useless to keep: whoever runs the
 * server has to capture stderr themselves, and a multi-line object cannot be
 * read back line by line. An agent left running for a week produces a log
 * nobody can grep and nobody bounded.
 *
 * This module adds the durable half. Entries are appended to a file as
 * **JSON Lines** — exactly one compact JSON object per line, so `tail`, `jq -c`
 * and any line-oriented shipper work on it directly — and the file is rotated
 * once it passes a size limit, keeping a fixed number of older generations.
 *
 * Rotation is the boring numbered-suffix scheme, deliberately: `audit.jsonl`
 * becomes `audit.jsonl.1`, `.1` becomes `.2`, and the generation past
 * `maxFiles` is deleted. It is obvious from a directory listing which file is
 * newest, and it needs no index or manifest that could disagree with what is
 * on disk.
 *
 * Everything is synchronous. An audit record that is buffered when the process
 * exits is an audit record that does not exist, and these writes are small and
 * infrequent relative to the network calls they describe.
