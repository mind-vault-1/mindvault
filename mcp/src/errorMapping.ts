/**
 * Structured error mapping for the MindVault MCP server.
 *
 * Failures reach an agent from four very different places — the MindVault API,
 * the x402 payment layer, Horizon, and the Soroban registry client — and each
 * one has its own failure vocabulary. Raw, they surface as opaque text like
 * `Browse failed: {"error":"..."}` or an unqualified `fetch failed`, which tells
 * an agent nothing about whether to retry, re-fund, fix its arguments, or stop.
 *
 * This module normalizes all of them into one shape: a category, the source that
 * failed, and a one-line action telling the agent what to do next. The mapping
 * is a pure function of (source, status, payload) — the same failure always
 * produces the same text, so agent behavior is reproducible and testable.
 *
 * `index.ts` owns the wiring; nothing here performs I/O.
