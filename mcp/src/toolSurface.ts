/**
 * The advertised tool surface — what ListTools returns (#596).
 *
 * `tools.ts` says of itself that it is "the single source of truth for the tool
 * surface advertised to agent clients", and `scripts/generate-tool-docs.ts`
 * builds `docs/mcp-tool-reference.md` on that promise. It was not true: the
 * ListTools handler in `index.ts` carried its own ~490-line literal copy of the
 * list, and the two drifted apart in every direction at once —
 *
 *   - Six implemented, documented, validated tools (`mindvault_update_metadata`,
 *     `mindvault_set_price`, `mindvault_transfer_ownership`,
 *     `mindvault_set_listed`, `mindvault_export_receipts`,
 *     `mindvault_recover_catalog_cache`) were missing from the copy, so no
 *     agent could discover them.
 *   - `mindvault_publish_status` and `mindvault_purchase_history` existed only
 *     in the copy, so the generated reference page never mentioned them.
 *   - The copy's schemas for `mindvault_register`, `mindvault_publish`,
 *     `mindvault_buy` and others had lost their per-field descriptions and
 *     examples, and `mindvault_publish`/`mindvault_buy` no longer advertised
 *     `dryRun` or `maxAutoPayUsdc` at all.
 *
 * Deriving the surface here makes the promise structural instead of
 * aspirational: there is one list, and `listToolsContract.test.ts` checks it
 * against the three other places a tool has to be registered (the argument
 * validator, the dispatch switch, and the annotation/output-schema maps).
 *
 * Two filters sit between the definitions and the wire, and both are deliberate:
 * tools with no handler are withheld, and read-only mode narrows the surface to
 * browsing (#593).

 * Defined and validated, but with no case in the dispatch switch.

 * `TOOL_ARGUMENT_SPECS`, an output schema, and a row in the generated tool
 * reference — but no handler, as `docs/mcp-structured-output.md` records. It is
 * withheld from ListTools rather than advertised: an agent that calls an
 * advertised tool and gets `Unknown tool` learns nothing useful, whereas one
 * that never sees it simply plans around it.
 *
 * This list is a ledger of known gaps, not a place to park new tools.
 * `listToolsContract.test.ts` asserts it names exactly the tools that are
 * missing a handler, so implementing `mindvault_set_tags` fails the suite until
 * this entry is removed, and adding a definition without a handler fails until
 * one is added here on purpose.
