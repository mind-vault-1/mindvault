/**
 * Structured diagnostics for sponsored-account service outages.
 *
 * `mindvault_setup_wallet` is the first tool an agent calls, and it depends on a
 * single external service — the sponsored-account service that mints and funds
 * the Stellar account. When that service is down the agent is stuck at step one,
 * so the failure has to explain itself: which service was called, whether it
 * answered at all, what kind of outage this is, whether retrying can help, and
 * how long to wait.
 *
 * The diagnostics used to be assembled inline in `setupWallet` and had three
 * gaps this module closes:
 *
 *  1. They only ran when the service returned a non-ok *response*. The most
 *     common outage — unreachable host, refused connection, timeout — throws at
 *     the transport layer before that code runs, so exactly the case that needed
 *     diagnostics produced none.
 *  2. Several answered statuses (502, 504, 404, 401) fell through to empty
 *     guidance, leaving the agent with no next step.
 *  3. An error body with no recognized message field was dumped verbatim into
 *     the agent-visible error, leaking the service's internal error codes and
 *     stack traces.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of (service URL, status, body, headers), so
 * the same outage always renders the same text and can be asserted in tests. No
 * I/O; `index.ts` owns the wiring.
